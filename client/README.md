# QualityFair Client App

## The app is tested using node version 16
- Test failed for v12 for building.  
- For versions >16 OPENSSL security patch, use of react-scripts version 2, and probably more reasons make it complicated to run the app even in local environment. 
- The dependency problems cause the vercel deployment failure.
- The reason for failing deployment to github pages seems to be related.
